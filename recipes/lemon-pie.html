        <h3>Recipe instructions: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle; 
                transfer to a 9-in. pie plate. Trim to 1/2 in. beyond rim of plate; 
                flute edge. Refrigerate 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 425°.</li>
            <li>Line crust with a double thickness of foil. Fill with pie weights, 
                dried beans or uncooked rice. Bake on a lower oven rack until edge is 
                golden brown, 20-25 minutes. Remove foil and weights; bake until bottom 
                is golden brown, 3-6 minutes longer. Cool on a wire rack. Reduce oven 
                setting to 350°.</li>
            <li>In a medium saucepan, combine sugar, cornstarch, flour and salt. 
                Gradually stir in water. Cook and stir over medium heat until thickened 
                and bubbly. Reduce heat; cook and stir 2 minutes more. Remove from the 
                heat.</li>
            <li>Gradually stir 1 cup of hot mixture into egg yolks; return all to saucepan. 
                Bring to boil. Cook and stir for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat. Stir in 
                the butter, lemon juice and zest until smooth. Pour into pie crust.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, beat egg whites and salt until stiff (but not dry) peaks form. 
                Gradually beat in sugar until soft peaks form. Spread over pie, sealing edges 
                to pastry. Bake at 350° until meringue is golden, 12-15 minutes. Cool. Store 
                any leftovers in the refrigerator.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl and put the dough aside to let it rest for at least four 
                or five hours.</li>

        </ol>
